# Medtor

Medtor, a free web application, is a mentor matching tool built to help pre-medical undergraduate students connect with medical student mentors. The web app uses an algorithm that compares relevant information (research interests, hobbies, future plans, etc.) from both pre-medical students and mentors to recommend optimal matches to the student. In association with Duke MAP, we want to promote the current mentorship program and create an efficient way of expanding mentor-mentee relationships.
